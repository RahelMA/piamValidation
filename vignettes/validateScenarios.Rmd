# Overview

The function `validateScenarios()` performs validation checks on IAM scenario data based on thresholds provided in a tailored
config file. These checks either analyse the agreement with historical reference data or expectations on the scenario data.

# Installation

The package is available via the R package repository of PIK. 

```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("piamValidation", repos = "https://rse.pik-potsdam.de/r/packages")
```

For more detailed information please refer to the [Readme](https://github.com/pik-piam/piamValidation/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

# Usage

## Scenario Data

You can pass IAMC-style .mif, .csv or .xlsx files or vectors of paths to the 
function. More precisely, any data file which can be read by
``quitte::read.quitte()`` featuring the columns: 

*Model, Scenario, Region, Variable, Unit, \<years\>*


## Configuration File

The config file is the place where the validation checks are defined. Filling
the file comes with a few rules - depending on the type of check which is being 
performed, different columns can or need to be filled.

![Rules for writing the config file.](./config_rules.jpg){width=100%}


**General Rules**

- historical reference data needs to read "historical" in the column "scenario"
- one set of thresholds per row
- only one reference period/model/scenario per data-slice (e.g. don't compare the same data against ref_model1 and ref_model2)
- define multiple variables with "\*" (one sub-level) or "\*\*" (all sub-levels)
- if period column is empty (= all):
  * historic: 2005 - 2020
  * scenario: < 2100
  * give range via yyyy-yyyy or comma-separated years

It is recommended to choose a historical reference source explicitly in the 
"ref_model" column for historical comparisons. Otherwise, all available 
historical sources will be averaged and the tooltip will show
``ref_model = "multiple"``.


### Use Case 1: relative comparison to historical data
| metric   | critical | variable     | model | scenario | region | period | min_red | min_yel | max_yel | max_red | ref_model | ref_scenario | ref_period |
|----------|----------|--------------|-------|----------|--------|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| relative | yes      | Emi\|CO2\|Energy |       |          |        |        | -0.25   | -0.2    | 0.2     | 0.25    | EDGAR8    | historical   |            |
| relative | yes      | Emi\|CO2\|Energy |       |          | World  |        | -0.2    | -0.1    | 0.1     | 0.2     | EDGAR8    | historical   |            |


### Use Case 2: difference to historical data

### Use Case 3: relative comparison to other model/scenario/period

### Use Case 4: difference to other model/scenario/period

### Use Case 5: direct comparison to absolute thresholds

### Use Case 6: direct comparison to yearly growthrate

## Scenario Validation

The function ``validateScenarios()`` performs all necessary steps of the 
validation process. It takes the config file and goes through each row, 
assembling the required data and checking the thresholds.

Optionally, you can save the resulting data.frame to a .csv file.

```{r run validation, eval = FALSE}
df <- validateScenarios(c(scenPath, histPath), config, outputFile = NULL)
```

## Create Validation Report

To perform the validation and create an output document in one go, the function
``validationReport()`` can be used. It renders an .html file which features heat 
maps for all variables described in the config file.

By default, the .Rmd ``validation_default`` is used, but alternatives can be 
used or created according to individual needs in ``inst/markdown``.

The report is saved in a folder called ``output`` in the current working 
directory.

```{r create report, eval = FALSE}
validationReport(c(scenPath, histPath), config, report = "default")
```
